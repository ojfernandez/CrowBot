# CrowBot - a Discord bot in D++

A Discord bot from [brainboxdotcc's template](https://github.com/brainboxdotcc/templatebot) for a simple [D++](https://dpp.dev) bot.
Discord Bot written in D++ in development for University of Washington Bothell students. Made by UWBOThell. 

## Compilation

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make -j

Start the bot:

    cd build

## Extending the bot

You can add as many header files and .cpp files into the src and include folders as you wish. All .cpp files in the src directory will be linked together into the bot's executable.
